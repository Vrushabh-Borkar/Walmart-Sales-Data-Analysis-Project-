# Walmart-Sales-Data-Analysis-Project-
This project aims to explore the Walmart Sales data to understand top performing branches and products, sales trend of different products, customer behavior. The aims to study how sales strategies can be improved and optimized.

Here we are provided with historical sales data for 45 Walmart stores located in different regions. Each store contains many departments, and participants must project the sales for each department in each store. To add to the challenge, selected holiday markdown events are included in the dataset. These markdowns are known to affect sales, but it is challenging to predict which departments are affected and the extent of the impact.
